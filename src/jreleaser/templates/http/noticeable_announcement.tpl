**Announce:** Post announcements to [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/).

**Catalog:** [cyclonedx-cli](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli) may be used to generate SBOMs.

**Package:** Several improvements and fixes applied to [Flatpak]{{projectLinkDocumentation}}/reference/packagers/flatpak.html. `SINGLE_JAR`
distributions are now supported by [Macports]({{projectLinkDocumentation}}/reference/packagers/macports.html). Zip
based distributions are now supported by [Winget]({{projectLinkDocumentation}}/reference/packagers/winget.html).

**Deploy:** Several updates to [Maven]({{projectLinkDocumentation}}/reference/deploy/maven/index.html) deployers. You may now individually
override all checks defined by the `applyMavenCentralRules` property, skip checking for `-sources` and `-javadoc` JARs on a given
artifact. Nexus2 now checks if GPG keys are publicly available before deployment.

**Hooks:** Command hooks may supply structured output that feeds into the resolved model {{projectLinkDocumentation}}/reference/hooks/command.html#_output
