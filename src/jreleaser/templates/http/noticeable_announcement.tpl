JReleaser {{projectVersion}} is now available! This release brings the following features:

This is mostly a fix release with a handful of enhancements. We'd like to thank our most recent [contributors](https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md)

**Release:** GitHub cannot handle release notes larger than 10K characters, thus the release now truncates release notes to 10k while also uploading the original as a release asset.

**Packagers:** Generated Homebrew formulas for Jlink distributions should now work on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) devices.

**Deploy:** Updates to the Nexus2 deployer where additional slashes were added to the target deployment path.
